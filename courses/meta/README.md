# Meta: Design and Develop Self-Guided Learning Dashboard

Category: Toys and Apps

Curriculum: Self

Ping: 20.12.2016

Start: 12.12.2016

## Week 1

Learning Goal: Refine idea and approach for personal "online course" management system

Start: 12.12.2016

End: 12.12.2016

Reflection: Although my initial idea for an MVP used a simple card-based HTML5 layout, it was very fun to use Jupyter Notebook for the current use-cases (**UC1: Get Outstanding Tasks** and **UC2: Celebrate Accomplishments**) and the third major use-case (**UC3: Showcase Project Porfolio**) is just not very pressing. In particular, I thought that using images would be crucial for the MVP, but it seems like that can be done later because the links, in the context of Jupyter's relatively minimal UI, provide amply call to action. Also, the combination of **Learning Goal and Reflection** already feels like a very powerful tool, to the extent that it would perhaps be useful to take a "curriculum" approach to large projects in general, rather than only "online curricula" in particular.

- [X] Explore minimalist, beutiful HTML5 themes; found [Prallelism](https://html5up.net/parallelism) and [Hydrogen](https://freehtml5.co/demos/hydrogen/), prefer Hydrogen but both nice.
- [X] Get a minimal viable product (MVP) running in Jupyter Notebook
- [X] Have at least one visualization of accomplishment in the MVP dash
- [X] Describe in the reflection the use cases and learnings
- [X] Lack of line breaks looks bad in the GH markdown viewer, so need to adjust the rules and the parser before plowing ahead with data migration
- [X] Figure out a way to deal with reading-centered tasks, and with reading notes (related more general probelm: links and relative references, as well as privacy - this repository is public, but book notes may need to stay private or with restricted visibility, such as the MHS text) such as in the art-of-programming self-guided course. Solution: just use google docs or other cloud hosting, using those sharing settings, and the URL and Keyword elements.

## Week 2

Learning Goal: Explore possibilities and limitations of current set-up, particulalry by identifying some outstanding projects and ideas and articulating them here.

Reflections: Already, one idea hasb een to just migrate tasks upwards if I get too excited (e.g., some of the tasks marked as completed from last week were actually initially here, but I got over-excited). The core difference between the weeks is off-time, and opportunity to dwell in the subsconscious on the various ideas, and allow them to germinate/rise/insert-cooking-metaphor here.

- [ ] Migrate all the other course data in here
- [ ] Develop several of own courses, such as German; Qual; or some arts and crafts stuff; blogging and memoiring; horror, short story writing, readings, etc, songwriting, whatever is in Evernote or Pinterest, etc
- [ ] Make initial comments on possible benefits of integrations
- [ ] Make more progress on recording and storing portfolio project  information, particularly the song and the game design characters, and write a script to combine the header+(items)+footer HTML to make a landing page

## Week 4

- [ ] Landing pages for courses: focusing on projects and reflections
- [ ] Write up comparison agains straight README rendering in GH markdown

## Week 3

Learning Goal: Investigate different integrations and identify (1) possible uses and (2) necessary, desirable, and nice-to-have features

- [ ] Follow up on Coursera API
- [ ] [Pinterest API](https://developers.pinterest.com/apps/4872901797745801441/)

## Week ?

Learning Goal: Investigate and try out some minimal (in time and cost) stacks for a database-backed application

- [ ] Cloud DB options: [A](http://www.htmlgoodies.com/html5/client/activity-so-you-want-to-build-and-deploy-a-web-app-to-the-cloud-at-low-to-no-cost.html#fbid=Bm_bDZAh1yL), [B](http://rdbhost.blogspot.de/2011/05/host-your-database-backed-site-on.html) and [B'](https://www.rdbhost.com/github_hosting.html)
