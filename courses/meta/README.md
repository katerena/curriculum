## Week 1

Learning Goal: Refine idea and approach for personal "online course" management system
Start: 12.12.2016

Reflection: Although my initial idea for an MVP used a simple card-based HTML5 layout, it was very fun to use Jupyter Notebook for the current use-cases (**UC1: Get Outstanding Tasks** and **UC2: Celebrate Accomplishments**) and the third major use-case (**UC3: Showcase Project Porfolio**) is just not very pressing. In particular, I thought that using images would be crucial for the MVP, but it seems like that can be done later because the links, in the context of Jupyter's relatively minimal UI, provide amply call to action. Also, the combination of **Learning Goal and Reflection** already feels like a very powerful tool, to the extent that it would perhaps be useful to take a "curriculum" approach to large projects in general, rather than only "online curricula" in particular.

[X] Explore minimalist, beutiful HTML5 themes; found [Prallelism](https://html5up.net/parallelism) and [Hydrogen](https://freehtml5.co/demos/hydrogen/), prefer Hydrogen but both nice.
[X] Get a minimal viable product (MVP) running in Jupyter Notebook
[X] Have at least one visualization of accomplishment in the MVP dash
[X] Describe in the reflection the use cases and learnings

## Week 2
