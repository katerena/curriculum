## Week 1

Learning Goal: Address the broader topic of combining audit-only online courses with self-curated (or self-developed) activities

- [ ] Watch video forthe first week
- [ ] Given that this is not a graded course, develop some auxilary assignments or activities, e.g., grawing on the books I already have (Celine, Girl with a Pearl Earring)
