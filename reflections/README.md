## science/notebook

- [ ] [Publication-ready iPy notebooks](http://blog.juliusschulz.de/blog/ultimate-ipython-notebook)

## science/literture

- [ ] Organized JabRef with much metadata and personal notes (also, renamed...)
- [ ] Started a crappy graph vis of authors in my library (see: CommunitiesVis ipynb), but would be good to look at existing ways to visualize bib files
- [ ] And to sketch out some of my own ideas, perhaps reflecting on the meta-analysis course?
