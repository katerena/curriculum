<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-character-design/peer/37ss8/opposites-attract">Opposites Attract</a> "In this assignment I'd like you to expand on the previous assignment and try drawing two characters for a possible game. Maybe one is a hero and another is a villain. One could be a boss and another could be an underling. The challenge will be to give each character a clearly different design. As an example, think of Andy's approach with his softer, rounder explorer and his harsher, sharper aliens. Or pair a mechanical style on one character with a more organic look for another character. Or a rustic approach on one character could contrast with a more modern approach on another character. ... Does each character have a different approach to their design? For example, do the characters vary in shape, pose, expression, proportion, mood, etc.?"</li>
